# ðŸ“… ISO Weeks Explained

## ðŸ”¹ What is an ISO Week?
An **ISO week** follows the **ISO 8601** standard, ensuring consistent week numbering. Key rules:
- **Weeks start on Monday**.
- **Week 1** is the first week with **at least 4 days in the new year**.
- A year has **52 or 53 weeks**, depending on its structure.

## ðŸ”¹ Why is the First Thursday Important?
The **first Thursday** helps determine **Week 1** because:
- It ensures the **majority of days in the first week** belong to the new year.
- If **January 1st falls on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday**, the first ISO week starts on the following Monday.
